# steam-data
This is a project were I performed EDA in a dataset with information from steam.


The gaming industry has reached a revenue stream of 138 billion dollars in 2021 and it's value keeps growing everyday. About 20 years ago, gaming was seen as hobby strictly for kids and now big companies finally realized it's potential and started investing hard on what is known to be one of the greatest entertainment industries of the 21ts century.

Amongst these companies, Valve is know for being one of the main players in the market not just due to the games they developed, but also because of their platform, Steam, which is the main gaming platform in the world with more 500,000 active players everyday.
Due to that I obtained from kaggle a dataset that contained data about users, the games they owned and the amount of hours played in those games. My main objective is to try to obtain any interesting insights based on the data, such as the most popular games, based on how many people have them and based on the amount of hours and also, see the amount of hours spent in those games.
